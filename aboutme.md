Welcome to my portfolio , here you will find my most recent projects and my contact 
information.


### Why am I learning Cyber Security

I am consistently amazed by the strength and functionality of computer programming and computers themselves. This inspires me to dive deep into my studies of Information Technology. Therefore, I am currently preparing to take my CompTia A+ Certification exam; I want to build a strong foundation of the basics of IT. With this strong base, I can progress to become a competent Penetration Tester .
