Welcome to my portfolio , here you will find my most recent projects and my contact 
information.


### Why am I learning Data Science 

I am consistently amazed by the strength and functionality of computer programming. This inspires me to dive deep into my studies of Data Science to grow my knowledge. Therefore, once I finish my Data Science Boot-Camp I will have the full array of knowledge of Python, SQL, Machine Learning and NLP. I plan to apply these skills toward a career in Cyber Security.
